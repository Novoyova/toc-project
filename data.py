    'sate':
    {
        'description': '''Sate (satay) varieties:

Sate (or satay) are marinated, skewered and grilled meats served with spicy sauce. The meat usually consists of diced or sliced chicken, goat, mutton, beef and pork, but you'll also find satay that's made with fish, tofu, eggs or minced blends.

Bali’s variant is the sate lilit. Made from either minced beef, chicken, fish, pork, or even turtle meat, it's mixed with coconut, coconut milk, and a rich blend of vegetables and spices. The satay is then wrapped around bamboo, sugarcane or lemongrass sticks before it's grilled over charcoal. You can enjoy sate lilit with or without dipping sauce.''',

    {
        'description': '''Nasi ayam and nasi campur: 

Bali’s take on chicken rice, nasi ayam and nasi campur are served at many warungs (small eateries) and restaurants throughout the island. A plate of white rice comes with different elements of Balinese food, such as a portion of babi guling (roast suckling pig) or betutu (spiced chicken or duck), mixed vegetables, and a dab of spicy sambal matah (Balinese sauce).

Nasi ayam and nasi campur are sometimes served with a bowl of soup. For those who do not want it too spicy, simply ask for it without the sambal.''',

    'betutu': 
    {
        'description': '''Bebek and ayam betutu:

Betutu is the slow-cooked equivalent of Bali’s babi guling (roast suckling pig). Suitable for those who don’t eat pork, this iconic Balinese dish consists of a whole chicken (ayam) or duck (bebek) stuffed with traditional spices, wrapped in banana leaves, then enveloped tight in the bark of a banana trunk. The entire thing is baked or buried in a coal fire for 6 to 7 hours, resulting in a rich and juicy meat that easily separates from the bones.''',

    'babi_guling': 
    {
        'description': '''Babi guling:

Babi guling is an all-time favourite, consisting of spit-roast pig stuffed with rich traditional spices and vegetable mixes such as cassava leaves, slowly rolled over (guling means "to roll" in Indonesian) a coal fire.

The crisp brown skins are prized, while the meat is a tender and juicy treat. At first, babi guling was a communal treat during special festivities and ceremonies, but you can find it at many warungs (food stalls) and restaurants that specialise in this dish.''',

        'description': '''Pisang Goreng:

Bali has such a variety of bananas from the small, sweet varieties to the large ones that look like a weapon. The different types make fried bananas a treat each time. Served with honey or palm sugar syrup, a little bit of flaked coconut or vanilla ice cream or just plain from the roadside stalls, nothing is better than Pisang Goreng.''',
